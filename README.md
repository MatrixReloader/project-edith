This project is a modern C++-based e-nail device that allows for various nail configurations and consumption peripherals. I am the sole developer, with two friends providing additional funding for this project.

This project serves as a test of my programming skills and aims to create a public repository for others to see. It may seem a bit unconventional to create a project focused on enhancing the THC consumption experience, but I'm excited about it!

## Closing Remarks
If you've read this far, thank you for your interest! I'd love to hear your comments, criticisms, or ideas. This project will be a work in progress for the foreseeable future, and I hope to develop the codebase and build new peripherals for EDITH as time goes on.
