## What is Project EDITH?
**EDITH**: **E**lectronic **D**evice for **I**ntegrative **T**etrahydrocannabinol **H**ardware

*Disclaimer: This project is heavily inspired by a repo from a fello github user. Check [acknowledgements](#authors-and-acknowledgements).*

This project is a modern C++ based e-nail device that allows for different nail configurations and consumption peripherals. Solo code developer, with two friends providing additional funding for this project.

This project is a test for my programming skills, and to make a public repo for people to see. Kinda crazy that I went with a repo on making a device to improve the THC consumption experience, but oh well.

Keyword soup for things related to this project: \(Blah\)

## Closing Remarks
If you've read this far thank you for your interest; I'd love to hear from you with comments, criticism or ideas! This project is going to be pretty much a work in progress for the forseablb future, and I hope to develop the codebase and build new peripherals for EDITH as days go by.
